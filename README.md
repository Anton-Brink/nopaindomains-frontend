nopaindomains-frontend

This project is used in conjunction with the nopaindomains-backend to allow the user to enter a domain name and then check whether it is available. I do plan on adding wishlist functionality that will allow users to put a domain in their wishlist and a function will be ran once a day to check whether the domain is available. This could perhaps be commercialized with a "premium" membership that checks once a minute at a price.

This is a very simple next.js again, barely any css, not proper, was just to play around and show some competency
